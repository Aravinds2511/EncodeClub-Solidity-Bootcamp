Week 1 Homework

1. Contract Address:
   [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4Af7c74e6160A4AEB81Ec3446B6Db5D28B1A4Bd6](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4Af7c74e6160A4AEB81Ec3446B6Db5D28B1A4Bd6)
   - Arvind deployed the HelloWorld contract on Sepolia testnet. Contract deployment was successful.
   - Contract address: 0x4Af7c74e6160A4AEB81Ec3446B6Db5D28B1A4Bd6
   - Transaction hash: 0xff3bd60241eb4cae8f5adce642762d2f017f1b5fb0a37cf6edca5fac6646510a
   - Current Owner: 0x2d303feda3042363bc52e486f974601856df30d9 (Arvind)

2. Arvind changed the text to 'owner is AravindS' by calling the function 'setText'. The transaction was successful.
   - Transaction hash: 0x71975fc500635302c003d3348f8fa1061314f557fdb3a2a9d4f510456490537c

3. Arvind changed the owner of the contract by calling the function 'transferOwnership' and setting 0x24786D0dE04031fE1CC6c1EC53ADa442e72Bd9A2 as the owner. The transaction was a success.
   - Transaction hash: 0x1743c769f548a2e35eefb0c3050b9706dd5dfb04584f2c046ed4c3fc9ceddc1b
   - Current Owner: 0x24786D0dE04031fE1CC6c1EC53ADa442e72Bd9A2 (Srijan)
  
4. After changing the owner, Arvind tried changing the text by calling the 'setText' function. As expected, it reverted with "Fail with error 'Caller is not the owner'".
   - Transaction hash: 0xead5a602a7fb1e8c288f11c2c6220d689106a22b9cd03302c6c09504b41fc1c7
